Description: Data analysis (and creating ML models) involves many stages. For early exploration, 
  it is useful to have a grip not only on individual series (AKA variables) available, 
  but also on relations between them. Unfortunately, 
  the task of understanding correlations between variables proves to be difficult. 
  CorrGrapheR package aims to plot correlations between variables in form of a graph. 
  Each node on it is associated with single variable. Variables correlated with each other 
  (positively and negatively alike) shall be close, and weakly correlated  - far from each other.
