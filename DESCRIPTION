Description: When exploring data or models we often examine variables one by one. 
  This analysis is incomplete if the relationship between these variables is 
  not taken into account. The corrgrapher package facilitates simultaneous 
  exploration of the Partial Dependence Profiles and the correlation between 
  variables in the model.
  The package 'corrgrapher' is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe.
